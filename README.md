## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes the economic efficiency of football transfers by measuring the relationship between transfer fees and player performance contributions. Using 238 paid transfers from Europe's Top 5 leagues (2020-2023), we calculate comprehensive efficiency metrics to identify value-for-money patterns and optimal spending strategies.

**Key Question:** *Are football clubs getting value for money in their transfer investments?*

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Overall Efficiency

- **Only 19.8%** of transfers achieve "Good" or "Excellent" efficiency
- **29.4%** are classified as "Poor" or "Very Poor"
- **Average efficiency score:** 49.28/100
- **Average cost-per-goal:** €5.63M

### Fee Bracket Analysis

| Fee Bracket | Avg Efficiency | Cost/Goal | Key Insight |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **<€1M** | **52.85** ✅ | €0.20M | **Most efficient** - low-cost signings deliver best value |
| €1-5M | 49.66 | €2.14M | Good balance of cost and performance |
| €5-10M | 50.66 | €3.98M | **Optimal sweet spot** - highest avg goals (3.12) |
| €10-20M | 48.83 | €6.24M | Below-average efficiency |
| €20-50M | 47.89 | €12.24M | Poor value relative to cost |
| **>€50M** | **35.52** ❌ | €42.76M | **Least efficient** - 27% below average |

### League Comparison

| League | Avg Efficiency | Avg Fee | Avg Goals | Insight |
|--------|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Serie A** | **53.26** ✅ | €6.9M | 1.98 | **Most efficient league** |
| Bundesliga | 50.31 | €6.1M | 2.23 | Strong value and development |
| La Liga | 49.73 | €4.8M | 2.41 | Moderate fees, good output |
| Ligue 1 | 47.59 | €10.6M | 2.15 | Underperforms relative to spending |
| **Premier League** | **45.67** ❌ | **€31.5M** | 3.43 | **Least efficient** - fee inflation |

### Position Analysis

| Position | Avg Efficiency | Avg Fee | Avg Goals |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Forward** | **51.90** ✅ | €15.2M | 4.22 |
| Midfielder | 51.52 | €15.7M | 2.34 |
| Defender | 45.36 | €7.1M | 0.71 |
| Goalkeeper | 32.75 | €5.6M | 0.00 |

*Note: Metrics are biased toward attacking positions (goals/assists). Defensive analysis requires separate metrics.*

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### For Football Clubs

1. **Target the €5-10M fee bracket**
   - Best balance of quality and efficiency
   - Highest average goals (3.12)
   - Above-average efficiency (50.66)

2. **Scout Serie A and Bundesliga**
   - Highest efficiency leagues (53.26 and 50.31)
   - Lower fee inflation than Premier League
   - Strong player development systems

3. **Leverage free/low-cost transfers**
   - Most efficient category (<€1M: 52.85 efficiency)
   - Target experienced players (27-30 years)
   - Low financial risk with high upside

4. **Avoid >€50M transfers unless essential**
   - Lowest efficiency (35.52)
   - High cost-per-goal (€42.76M)
   - Only justified for proven world-class talent

5. **Prioritize forwards and midfielders**
   - Highest efficiency scores (51.90 and 51.52)
   - Measurable attacking contributions
   - Justify investment through goals/assists

### Key Correlation Insights

- **Transfer fee ↔ Efficiency:** -0.160 (negative) ⚠️
- **Goals ↔ Efficiency:** +0.476 (strong positive) ✅
- **Assists ↔ Efficiency:** +0.450 (strong positive) ✅
- **VfM Score ↔ Efficiency:** +0.496 (strong positive) ✅

**Implication:** Performance drives efficiency, not price. Data-driven scouting can identify undervalued players.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Efficiency Metrics

#### 1. Value-for-Money (VfM) Score
```
VfM = Performance Index (0-100) / Transfer Fee (€M)
```
Performance per million euros spent.

#### 2. Cost-per-Goal
```
Cost-per-Goal = Transfer Fee (€M) / Goals After Transfer
```
Investment required per goal scored.

#### 3. Cost-per-Contribution
```
Cost-per-Contribution = Transfer Fee (€M) / (Goals + Assists)
```
Investment required per goal contribution.

#### 4. Composite Efficiency Score
```
Efficiency = 0.4 × VfM + 0.3 × CPG⁻¹ + 0.3 × CPC⁻¹
```
Weighted composite metric (0-100 scale).

### Performance Index Components

- **Goals After Transfer** (weighted 10×)
- **Assists After Transfer** (weighted 5×)
- **Minutes Played** (weighted 0.5×)

All metrics normalized to 0-100 scale for comparability.

### Efficiency Categories

| Category | Score Range | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 80-100 | Exceptional value |
| **Good** | 60-79 | Above-average value |
| **Average** | 40-59 | Market-standard value |
| **Poor** | 20-39 | Below-average value |
| **Very Poor** | 0-19 | Significant overpayment |
